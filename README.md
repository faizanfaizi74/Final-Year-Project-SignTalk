# Final-Year-Project-SignTalk

#I made this project with my group partner during my final year project at Namal University Mianwali.

#Objective was to build a deep learning model that can recognize signs based on video input for word and sentences. The project required a mobile application for easy use.

#A Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Netwrok architecture has been trained on raw data videos (after pre-processing)

#Uses implemented model in mobile testing by using android application to recognize various words and sentence from their corresponding signs.
